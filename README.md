### Use of Artificial Intelligence
Gemini was used to optimize the development workflow of this project. Some usages included:
- Assist with testing the program
- Logical improvement of functions
- Improve understanding of some concepts
- Quick and small debbugg checks throgout the making of this program
- Makefile adjustments
- Improve this README wording

All algorithm and implementation of the logic in this program are the author's own work.
